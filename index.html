          <h2> Chicken </h2>
            <p>Chicken and beer: so simple, yet, so good. This Italian classic is a perfect lunch or dinner for two. It uses a few ingredients but has a deep, complex flavor. The cornstarch helps create a thick and creamy sauce. Serve with mashed potatoes and a small salad for a complete meal.</p>

          <h2> Beef </h2>
            <p>My Grandmother 'Nanaw' Rowan made the most delicious meatloaf in the state. When she passed away, she didn't leave me her recipe, but she left me the desire to recreate it. I think this is it, in flavor and texture. Don't let the number of ingredients discourage you. It's part of the magic in creating a masterpiece!</p>

          <h2> Sushi </h2>
            <p>The following is a basic spicy sushi roll, readily suitable for either crab or tuna. Different people will be suited to different degrees of spiciness for the sauce, so you may want to adjust proportions accordingly to your liking. Final product will be cool and slightly sweet at first, with a tight, hot afterbite following, and then linger for a while after with a duller burning, flavorful taste.</p>
